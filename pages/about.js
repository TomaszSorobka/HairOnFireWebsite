        <p>Welcome to Hair On Fire, an online repository of studentsâ€™ problems sourced from various forums, that serves as an inspiration for entrepreneurial students looking to start their own business or side-hustle.
<br></br><br></br>
We understand that finding a valid business idea can be challenging, especially for students who lack significant industry experience. That's why we've created this platform to provide a solution to this problem.
<br></br><br></br>
Our website is designed for entrepreneurial students who are looking for inspiration on what actual and real problems they can solve and potentially turn into a successful business. We provide a comprehensive list of problems, sourced from various student forums, that are relevant to our users.
<br></br><br></br>
At Hair On Fire, we believe that the best way to find a business idea is by solving a real problem. Our platform allows students to explore a wide range of problems that are encountered by students in their daily lives. These problems can be anything from issues related to academics, student life, health, and more.
<br></br><br></br>
Our mission is to provide our users with an insight into actual and real problems faced by students, so they can come up with a solution that can potentially turn into a successful business. By providing access to these problems, we hope to inspire entrepreneurial students to think outside the box and find innovative solutions to real-world problems.
<br></br><br></br>
Each problem listed on our platform links back to the post on the forum where it was originally posted. This allows our users to validate the problem and get additional context and input from relevant stakeholders.
<br></br><br></br>
We are committed to providing our users with a valuable resource that can help them kickstart their entrepreneurial journey. We believe that by solving real problems, students can not only start a successful business but also make a positive impact on their community.
